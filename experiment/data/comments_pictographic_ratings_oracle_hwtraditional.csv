"{""Q0"":""I liked it a lot""}"
"{""Q0"":""Since i like history i want you to do ma a favour and write which chinese dynasty was your favourite. :) I'll go first: Qing because i like how manchu took mandate of heaven from Ming empire. Your answer can send to: ---@---.com\nI hope you have a great day.""}"
"{""Q0"":""Due to quality of scans some of characters were hard to distinguish. Overall it was fun to participate. Thank you and good luck with your research!""}"
"{""Q0"":""the more complex characters were those without symmetry""}"
"{""Q0"":""Thank you for this enjoyable test. Don't know if this was really chinese characters, but some of them were really cool.""}"
"{""Q0"":""very interesting , i was virtually trying to draw the characters or letters in my mind seeing which one is most difficult .""}"
"{""Q0"":""It was fun to participate in this study :)""}"
"{""Q0"":""there were hardly any where i pointed R3 or L3""}"
"{""Q0"":""I thought the tast was simple to uderstand and well explained.""}"
"{""Q0"":""I think that the exercise should specify complexity over it consisting of more elements or complex by how difficult it would be to trace it based on the rules to write chinese characters""}"
"{""Q0"":""The task was usderstood, but I think that you should add a following where the chinese symbols are the same dificult.""}"
"{""Q0"":""Thanks, it was interesting!""}"
"{""Q0"":""A fun survey, thanks! ""}"
"{""Q0"":""I tried to ignore the thickness of the lines, but sometimes it was hard to do so as it made the form more complex and harder to see how I would draw it, which was easier with the thinner lines. ""}"
"{""Q0"":""I focused on how complex it would be for me to recreate""}"
"{""Q0"":""thicker were less readable""}"
"{""Q0"":""That was a nice task""}"
"{""Q0"":""I felt a couple were the same or looked very very similar, perhaps the difference being digital or handwritten and would have rated them equally complex if there was an option, otherwise all good""}"
"{""Q0"":""I don't know if you could write/paint some of those ideograms without the \""spaces\"" in the lines, but if you can those are probably far easier to remember""}"
"{""Q0"":""-""}"
"{""Q0"":""Could be an option for \""same difficulty\"" as I thought some of the characters were identical in difficulty.""}"
"{""Q0"":""Some of the characters might be more or less complex, but my mind constantly thought about what would be easier to recreate by hand as well... Like what would be more efficient rather than complex. Was a strange thought considering I know nothing about Chinese characters!""}"
"{""Q0"":""I loved this task! I am actually on the process of learning Japanese right now (actually, since 2018 but I can never find the time to devote to learning it), so I have acquired some knowledge on Chinese characters. I love how each stroke has a meaning that represents the word. It's very interesting to study languages and how they evolve over time and especially letters and ideograms. Thank you for allowing me to participate! I wish you the very best!""}"
