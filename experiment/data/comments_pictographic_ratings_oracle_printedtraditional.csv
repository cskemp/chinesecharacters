"{""Q0"":""Well, you should have put an equally complex option too.""}"
"{""Q0"":""I liked it because I have curiosity for the Chinese script ---- @----.com""}"
"{""Q0"":""Nothing.""}"
"{""Q0"":""Through technology and printing the characters have changed a bit but for the most of them you can see how they relate and how similar they are to each other.""}"
"{""Q0"":""Nice.""}"
"{""Q0"":""i love china and chinese!!!""}"
"{""Q0"":""It was very useful and nice ""}"
"{""Q0"":""No comments, harder than I thought though!""}"
"{""Q0"":""I made a mistake on one that was really obviously less complex and accidentally clicked that it was more complex sorry. \n\n""}"
"{""Q0"":""these characters are more the same, my judging of their complexity is mostly based on their minor differences. so in some of my answers I actually took the time and tried writing them down then made my decision based on the time it took me to write them down.  ""}"
"{""Q0"":""You should probably redraw the characters that are digitally distorted. I am talking about the ones which are very thin lines. It would be fairly easy to redraw them more clearly, but still keep the original shape.""}"
"{""Q0"":""i didn't really get the complexity term. did you mean how difficult it is to draw it? ----- @----.com""}"
"{""Q0"":""I tried to answer based on how different they look but also on how much more complex it looked to write the characters. Of course I have never written a Chinese character in my life so it's hard to understand! ""}"
"{""Q0"":""I think that should be an equal option.""}"
"{""Q0"":""I think you should also give an \""middle\"" option like there were pairs i didn't think any of them is more complex than the other.\n\nIf that's possible i would like you to send me a file of all the pairs just to check it out again it was really really interesting to see the differences! I am studying Korean so i'm into Asian languages. That's my email - ----@-----.com\n\nThank you!""}"
"{""Q0"":""Nothing to add. It's been really curious and pleasant to know some chinese characters, it would have been nice to know their meanings at the same time. Thank you!""}"
"{""Q0"":""the \""equal\"" button was missing for me in several cases. Some characters I saw did not seem to have changed in *complexity* at all if you ignore the stroke thickness etc. ""}"
"{""Q0"":""I can't think of anything, sorry.""}"
"{""Q0"":""fascinating ; now keen to learn more.""}"
"{""Q0"":""None""}"
"{""Q0"":""some characters appeared more complex to me because I felt they would have been harder to write, more difficult to understand how they're constructed. I'm not sure if this is a valid approach to the test, but I hope it is. Good luck on your study!""}"
"{""Q0"":""no""}"
"{""Q0"":""it was a cool survey""}"
"{""Q0"":""Interesting study\n""}"
"{""Q0"":""This task was interesting ""}"
"{""Q0"":""interesting test, sometimes the characters have changed so much that it's hard to compare them""}"
"{""Q0"":""In the tutorial, when describing what R3/R2/R1 means, the comparison is incorrect. You outline that users are to compare the right with the right side. ""}"
"{""Q0"":""Very interesting task. Would like to know (for information purposes) on how the characters have evolved over time. I think this is the basis of traditional vs simplified mandarin.""}"
