#Write a shiny app with a line graph that displays data from a file on my computer called character_complexity.csv. The file contains three columns: character, period and complexity.  First, add a side bar with a dropdown that lets users choose which character they want to plot. The line graph should show period on the x-axis and character on the y-axis.
